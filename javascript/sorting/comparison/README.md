# Code Challenge 28

## Challenges, Features, and API
Compare and Sort Movies

Write functions which sort domain objects. Your functions will receive an array of Movie objects. Each Movie object has a title (string), a year (number), and a list of genres (array of strings). One function will sort the movies by most recent year first. One function will sort the movies, alphabetical by title, but will ignore any leading “A”s, “An”s, or “The”s. Tests for these functions, and an array of sample data, have been provided in test.js and movies.js.

Write tests for comparator functions. Tests will need to call the comparator functions directly, and make assertions about the response values given test inputs.

## Challenges, Features, and API

### Binary Tree BST Implementation

![UML]()

### Binary Tree
- Create a Binary Tree class
- Depth first traversals:
  - Pre order
  - In order
  - Post order

Each depth first traversal method should return an array of values, ordered appropriately.

### Binary Search Tree
- Create a Binary Search Tree class
  - This class should be a sub-class (or your languages equivalent) of the Binary Tree Class, with the following additional methods:
  - Add
    - Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
  - Contains
    - Takes in a value and return a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
